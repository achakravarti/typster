This is the first game that I'm building, after a couple of decades of failed
attempts at getting around to start doing so. I was looking for a simple game
idea to start with that would help me get my toes wet with game development in
general and SDL specifically. I initially thought of writing a Hangman clone,
but this idea progressed to Typster.

The basic premise of Typster is simple -- you need to type out the words being
thrown down to you by the Typster (typo trickster) before they crash down into
the city wall you are defending. If you type out the word incorrectly, or fail
to complete typing the word before it reaches the wall, the wall is damaged a
bit. You lose the game when the wall is completely broken down.
